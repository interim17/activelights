my current touch designer controller for LED strip, DMX lights, and projector

indebted to Karl Skene, Markus Heckmann, Bileam Tschepe and others

python files are scripts referenced somewhere in the TD network
paths would need to be fixed were you to clone the repo and run the controller

it's not cleaned up, user friendly, or well documented so good luck trying to use it lol, but you're welcome to.
